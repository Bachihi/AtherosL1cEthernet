# AtherosL1cEthernet
Qualcomm Atheros AR813x/815x driver for macOS.

This driver is based off the [`atl1c` Linux driver](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/drivers/net/ethernet/atheros/atl1c).
It was originally ported to Mac OS X by maolj, and was later [updated by Shailua](http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/283086-updated-atheros-ar8131325152-driver-for-107108)
in 2012 for newer Qualcomm Atheros Ethernet chipsets (AR815x) and Mac OS X 10.7.
